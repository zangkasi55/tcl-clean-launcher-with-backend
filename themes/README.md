# Themes

A theme is a folder with a `config.json` and, optionally, a `wallpaper.jpg`. Pushing one changes the
launcher's dock, layout and look on the TV without rebuilding the APK: the launcher reads
`config.json` as an overlay over its built-in `config.xml` the next time it starts.
Choices made in Launcher settings take priority until you choose Follow theme. Pushing a theme or
using `tools/theme.sh --reset` also clears those on-TV column and motion choices.

```bash
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh themes/aurora          # push a theme and restart Home
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh --reset                # back to the built-in config.xml
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\theme.ps1 -TvHost 192.168.1.50 themes\aurora
```

| Theme | What it does |
|---|---|
| `default/` | The built-in look written out as JSON, as a starting point for your own |
| `aurora/` | An image-free navy background; add your own private wallpaper if desired |
| `six-columns/` | Six smaller tiles per row and one grid row visible under the dock |

## Keys

Every key is optional; a missing key keeps the value from `config.xml`, an unknown or wrongly typed key
is ignored, and a file that doesn't parse is ignored as a whole, so a theme can never break Home.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `dock_apps` | list of package names | The dock row, in order; missing apps are skipped |
| `hidden_apps` | list of package names | Never shown as tiles |
| `live_tv_package`, `live_tv_action` | string | The Live TV app and, if it has no leanback entry, the action to start it with |
| `source_panel_service`, `source_panel_action` | string | The TV's own source panel, for sets with no TvInputManager |
| `input_action` | string | Action sent with an HDMI/AV row's channel URI when nothing handles the standard `VIEW` (XGIMI: `com.xgimi.action.hdmiPlayer`) |
| `columns` | 1 to 8 | Tiles per row; tiles shrink to fit from 5 up |
| `rows_below_dock` | 0 to 3 | Grid rows left visible under the dock |
| `shamsi_date` | bool | Show the Solar Hijri date above the Gregorian one |
| `module_cards` | bool | Look for module cards and ask about them (`true`); `false` turns the feature off |
| `reduced_motion` | bool | Calmer motion for weak GPUs: stiff highlight spring, no tile overshoot, short fades, no entrance replay |
| `vpn_app` | string | App the network pill opens when a VPN is configured; also shows a red "VPN off" badge while no VPN is up |
| `animations` | bool | Basic focus, glass, title and tile entrance motion; true by default |
| `advanced_effects` | bool | Optional lifted tile, icon zoom, smooth ambient colour and app opening effects; false by default |
| `show_home_settings_shortcut` | bool | Keep the optional Default-home tile visible when the TV has a home picker; false by default |
| `background_color` | `#RRGGBB` | Colour behind everything; black by default |
| `sky_intensity` | 0 to 100 | Time-of-day backdrop: a dark gradient that follows the clock, 0 hides it (default) |
| `wallpaper` | bool | Show `wallpaper.jpg` from the theme folder (`true`), or ignore it (`false`) |

## Wallpapers

The TCL controller build also accepts `app_order` (full package/activity components),
`tile_artwork` (component to content-addressed image filename), and `wallpaper_file`.
It shows ordinary launcher entries as well as TV entries, without merging distinct aliases.
Custom tile artwork overrides the app banner and icon only in this launcher; installed APKs are untouched.
`energy_panel` controls the lower energy-flow view (enabled by default on this TCL branch).
Its readings come from the separately selected direct-HA connection or backend
`energy.json` snapshot, never a token or an external page in the theme.
Missing or stale data is labeled, not replaced with zero.
The energy card is left-aligned and measures 30% of the entire screen width,
with a 128 dp height. The read-only Haval card occupies exactly 10% of full-screen
width between Energy and the optional 30%-width Weather card.
Backend file reads stay off the UI thread; direct WSS ownership follows visible
cards and disconnects while hidden. Unchanged heartbeats do not redraw cards.
Source and credentials are not theme properties: use the separate
[direct-HA mapping/TV setup](../docs/DIRECT_HA.md).
The controller validates and resizes images and uploads immutable image files before atomically
activating their configuration. Original `wallpaper.jpg` themes remain supported.

`wallpaper.jpg` is drawn full screen behind the launcher, centre-cropped. Keep it dark, 1920×1080 and
under about 300 KB: the text, the hero name and the dock band are designed for black, and a 1 GB TV
decodes the picture into memory on every Home start. Pictures larger than the screen are downsampled.
No sample wallpaper is shipped in `aurora/`. To use one privately, place your own
`wallpaper.jpg` in that folder and set `"wallpaper": true`; do not commit the photo.
Alternatively, use the controller's [crop/save workflow](../docs/USER_GUIDE.md#choose-and-crop-a-wallpaper).

## Reduced motion

`"reduced_motion": true` keeps the look but calms the movement: the highlight spring is stiff instead
of bouncing, tiles zoom without overshoot, fades are shorter, and Home does not replay the tile
entrance when you come back to it. Use it on TVs whose GPU cannot keep up; a MediaTek MT5895 on
Android 10 is the known case. The default, `false`, keeps the normal motion.

```json
{ "reduced_motion": true }
```

## Time-of-day backdrop

`"sky_intensity": 60` draws a dark gradient over the wallpaper and behind everything else, that follows the
clock: night blues, a soft blue day, then a warm horizon that peaks just before eight in the evening.
The glow near the bottom edge travels from left to right with the sun. The colours stay dark so the
white clock, the hero name and the dock band keep their contrast. It is drawn as one 480×270 bitmap
and redrawn once a minute, never animated, so even a 1 GB TV has nothing to keep up with. `0` keeps
the plain background; the default is off (the reference launcher looks exactly as before).

```json
{ "sky_intensity": 60 }
```

## Adding a theme

Open a PR with a new folder here and a one-line row in the table above. Keep the
dock list generic unless the theme is for a specific TV, and state what you tested.
Do not attach personal wallpapers or real household screens. Use a clearly labeled
synthetic sandbox preview when a picture helps; distinguish it from real-TV evidence.
Follow the [upload policy](../docs/PRIVACY.md).
